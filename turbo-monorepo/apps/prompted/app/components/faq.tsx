    question: "Who writes the prompts?",
    answer:
      "The prompts are crafted by the Prompted team to spark creativity and self-reflection. We focus on universal questions that anyone can enjoy. In the future, we might add AI-generated prompts or let the community contribute.",

    value: "application-developer",
    question: "Who developed this application?",
    answer:
      "Prompted was created by Eesha Moona, a software engineer. The app is built with Next.js, React, and Mantine, deployed on Vercel, and uses Supabase for authentication and database management.",
  },
  {
    value: "data-privacy",
    question: "How is my data handled?",
    answer:
      "We use Supabase to manage data securely, with encryption for data in transit and at rest. We only store what's necessary, and for AI interactions, no personal info is includedâ€”just the relevant text.",

  {
    value: "feedback-suggestions",
    question: "How can I provide feedback or suggest new features?",

    question: "Are there any subscription plans or in-app purchases?",

  {
    value: "ai-usage",
    question: "How does the app use AI?",
    answer:
      "AI helps in two ways: giving writing suggestions and providing feedback. For suggestions, it uses the last 500 characters of your text to help with writer's block. Feedback analyzes the final submission, keeping your identity private.",
