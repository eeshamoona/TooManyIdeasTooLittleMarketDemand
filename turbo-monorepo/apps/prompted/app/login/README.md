# Login Folder

This folder contains the logic for the login functionality of the application. It includes both server-side and client-side components to handle user authentication.

## Overview

The `login` folder is responsible for:

1. **Server Functions**: Handling server-side logic for user authentication.
2. **Client Components**: Providing the user interface for the login page.

## Folder Structure

```plaintext
login/
├── actions.ts
└── page.tsx
```

### Files

#### 1. actions.ts

The `actions.ts` file contains the server-side functions for handling user authentication. It includes functions for logging in, logging out, and verifying user credentials.

##### Example Implementation

```typescript
// actions.ts
import { createClient } from "../../utils/supabase/server";

export async function login(formData: FormData) {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const email = formData.get("email") as string;
  const password = formData.get("password") as string;

  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });

  if (error) {
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }

  return { message: "Login successful" };
}

export async function signup(formData: FormData) {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const email = formData.get("email") as string;
  const password = formData.get("password") as string;

  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password });

  if (error) {
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }

  return { message: "Signup successful" };
}
```

##### Explanation

- **Imports**: The necessary functions are imported from the `supabase` utility module to create a Supabase client.

- **Login Function**: The `login` function takes a `FormData` object as its parameter, extracts the email and password fields, and attempts to sign in the user using the `signInWithPassword` method from Supabase.

- **Signup Function**: The `signup` function is similar to the `login` function but uses the `signUp` method to create a new user account. Signup will automatically send a confirmation email to the user. auth/confirm folder is responsible for handling the confirmation link.

#### 2. page.tsx

The `page.tsx` file contains the client-side components for the login page. It includes form elements for user input and entry.

## TODO List

### Authentication Features

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for login and signup actions to provide clear feedback to users.
- [ ] **Password Reset**: Add functionality to allow users to reset their passwords via email.
- [ ] **Password Strength Meter**: Implement a password strength meter for the signup form to help users create strong passwords.
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Add client-side and server-side validation for login and signup forms to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.
- [ ] **Social Login**: Integrate social login options (e.g., Google, Facebook) to provide users with more convenient authentication methods.

### User Interface Improvements

- [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the overall UI/UX of the login page to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
