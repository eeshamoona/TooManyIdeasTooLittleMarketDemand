**Overview of the Creative Writing App**

This app is designed to help users explore creative writing with ease and enjoyment. Here’s a look at how it works and what features it offers:

### 1. Write Tab

The **Write tab** is where it all begins. You can either **generate a random prompt** or **select a specific category** to make the random prompts more tailored to your mood. Alternatively, you can **search through a list of prompts** to find something that sparks your interest. Once you've chosen a prompt, you’re ready to start writing in a **simple text box**.

When you've written **at least 100 characters**, you have the option to use AI to help generate the **next sentence** in case you get stuck. Additionally, there’s a **lightbulb icon** that lets you hover and see which parts of the text were AI-generated versus what you wrote. At the bottom of the page, you'll also find **some writing statistics**.

### 2. Submit and Achieve

After submitting your response, if you have **achieved any level-ups or special milestone achievements**, they will be displayed. From there, you’re taken to a page where you can **read your work** and view additional details.

### 3. Insights into Your Writing

When you review your completed entry, you’ll get **in-depth statistics** about your writing, including metrics like the time it took to write, **unique word percentage**, and more. There’s also a dedicated tab for **AI-generated feedback** broken down into five categories: **mood, relevance, creativity, completeness**, and **readability**. You can also explore your **word frequency** represented visually in a **word bubble chart**.

### 4. Entry Management

All your entries are stored and easily accessible in the **Entries section**, where you can **filter** and **search** through your work, allowing you to track your creative journey effortlessly.

### 5. Progress Page

The **Progress page** is where your achievements shine. Here, you can view both **level-up badges** and **milestone badges** that you’ve earned. You’ll also find **charts** that represent your writing data, such as **category frequency totals** and a **calendar heatmap** to visualize your progress over time.

### Primary Goal of the App

The main goal of this app is to make **creative writing accessible and fun** for everyone. We know that starting with a prompt can sometimes be challenging, that **writer’s block** can be a real struggle, and that instant feedback on creative writing is hard to come by—especially for short pieces. By **gamifying** the process, this app aims to remove those barriers and make creative writing an engaging, positive experience that can contribute to **grounding and mental well-being**.

### AI Assistance

AI is used in two key ways: it helps by suggesting **sentence starters** while you're writing and provides **feedback** on your work after submission. Everything else is about **tracking stats directly** from your writing—so the core creativity remains yours.

### Badges and Achievements

There are two types of badges to motivate your progress: **level badges** and **milestone badges**.

- **Level badges** progress past various thresholds, and **milestone badges** are one-time achievements.
- Both types of badges can be achieved whenever your writing meets the set criteria, so the more you write, the more you'll achieve!

### Writing Prompts and Creativity

All of the writing prompts are designed to inspire **joyous creativity**. The questions are crafted to help you be **inquisitive, descriptive**, and **imaginative**. They can also support **visualization** and **grounding**, with prompts that are specific enough to inspire **short, focused responses**.

### Captivating Landing Page

The **landing page** aims to capture the attention of diverse users who would find creative writing interesting and rewarding, making it accessible to anyone who’s ready to give it a try. To do this the user can have the option to go through a personality quiz that cleverly asks questions that point out which features would be helpful to them, and ultimately leading them to one category. They can try writing right away with a random prompt in that category, and the opportunity to use AI to help generate a sentence 3 time maximum. When they are ready to save, it will prompt them to sign up for an account. I want to make sure to save the data that they end up writing about so they don't loose their progress on their first entry, it should basically interrupt the process right befor eit is about to submit and has them sign up and then resumes to submit the entry and show them the achievements which will definetly show the "completed first prompt" milestone so they will feel motivated that they have already gotten started.
