**Overview of the Creative Writing App**

This app is designed to help users explore creative writing with ease and enjoyment. Here’s a look at how it works and what features it offers:

### 1. Write Tab

The **Write tab** is where it all begins. You can either **generate a random prompt** or **select a specific category** to make the random prompts more tailored to your mood. Alternatively, you can **search through a list of prompts** to find something that sparks your interest. Once you've chosen a prompt, you’re ready to start writing in a **simple text box**.

When you've written **at least 100 characters**, you have the option to use AI to help generate the **next sentence** in case you get stuck. Additionally, there’s a **lightbulb icon** that lets you hover and see which parts of the text were AI-generated versus what you wrote. At the bottom of the page, you'll also find **some writing statistics**.

### 2. Submit and Achieve

After submitting your response, if you have **achieved any level-ups or special milestone achievements**, they will be displayed. From there, you’re taken to a page where you can **read your work** and view additional details.

### 3. Insights into Your Writing

When you review your completed entry, you’ll get **in-depth statistics** about your writing, including metrics like the time it took to write, **unique word percentage**, and more. There’s also a dedicated tab for **AI-generated feedback** broken down into five categories: **mood, relevance, creativity, completeness**, and **readability**. You can also explore your **word frequency** represented visually in a **word bubble chart**.

### 4. Entry Management

All your entries are stored and easily accessible in the **Entries section**, where you can **filter** and **search** through your work, allowing you to track your creative journey effortlessly.

### 5. Progress Page

The **Progress page** is where your achievements shine. Here, you can view both **level-up badges** and **milestone badges** that you’ve earned. You’ll also find **charts** that represent your writing data, such as **category frequency totals** and a **calendar heatmap** to visualize your progress over time.

### Primary Goal of the App

The main goal of this app is to make **creative writing accessible and fun** for everyone. We know that starting with a prompt can sometimes be challenging, that **writer’s block** can be a real struggle, and that instant feedback on creative writing is hard to come by—especially for short pieces. By **gamifying** the process, this app aims to remove those barriers and make creative writing an engaging, positive experience that can contribute to **grounding and mental well-being**.

### AI Assistance

AI is used in two key ways: it helps by suggesting **sentence starters** while you're writing and provides **feedback** on your work after submission. Everything else is about **tracking stats directly** from your writing—so the core creativity remains yours.

### Badges and Achievements

There are two types of badges to motivate your progress: **level badges** and **milestone badges**.

- **Level badges** progress past various thresholds, and **milestone badges** are one-time achievements.
- Both types of badges can be achieved whenever your writing meets the set criteria, so the more you write, the more you'll achieve!

### Writing Prompts and Creativity

All of the writing prompts are designed to inspire **joyous creativity**. The questions are crafted to help you be **inquisitive, descriptive**, and **imaginative**. They can also support **visualization** and **grounding**, with prompts that are specific enough to inspire **short, focused responses**.

### Captivating Landing Page

The **landing page** aims to capture the attention of diverse users who would find creative writing interesting and rewarding, making it accessible to anyone who’s ready to give it a try. To prime the user they can optionally take this 4 questions quiz to customize the landing page to their own use cases. There is of course an option to skip and view the default landing page.
